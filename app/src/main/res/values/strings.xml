    <string name="infoView1">\n<b>Some Information on Hearing: </b>\n\n•Hearing is the ability to perceive sounds. Sound occurs over a wide spectrum of frequencies.
								The human ear is sensitive to a frequency band within that spectrum expressed in decibels
								(dB).
								\n\n•Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called audio or sonic. The range is
								typically considered to be between 20 Hz and 20 ,000 Hz (Hertz).
								\n\n•Frequencies higher than
								audio are referred to as ultrasonic, while frequencies below audio are referred to as
								infrasonic. Loss of the ability to hear sound frequencies in the normal range of hearing is
								called hearing impairment.\n\n
        <b>You may have a hearing loss if:</b>
        						\n\n•You hear people speaking but you have difficulty understanding what they are saying
								\n\n•You are frequently having to ask people to repeat what they have said
								\n\n•You feel left out of conversations
								\n\n•You complain that others are mumbling
								\n\n•You need to ask colleagues about the details of a meeting or presentation you attended
								\n\n•You miss jokes because you didn\'t hear all of what was said
								\n\n•Friends and family need you to turn the TV or radiodown
								\n\n•You do not hear the telephone and or doorbell
								\n\n•You have difficulty working out where sounds are coming from
								\n\n•You have a history of exposure to loud noise e.g. working in the construction industry
								\n\n•You understand more of what is being said if you are looking at the person speaking to you
								\n\n•Soft sounds seem to have disappeared altogether in speech
                                \n•Pure tone audiometry is the standard assesment of an individual\'s hearing.\n\n•The results of a pure tone audiometry test are recorded onto a chart called an audiogram.
	    					    \n\n•It is an easy method to obtain and provide information about an individuals hearing across a range of frequencies.
	    					    \n\n•A pure tone is a tone that has a single specific frequency.This tone is determined by the rate, or speed at which the sound waves vibrate.
	    					    \n\n•A 4000 Hz tone has a higher frequency than the 500 Hz tone.
        \n\n<b>The Auditory System:</b>\n\nThe system of the body that lets a person hear sound is called the auditory system. It is made up of four main parts.
The visible part of the ear and the ear canal make up the outer ear.
The area behind the eardrum is called the middle ear. It is made up of the three smallest bones in the body (malleus, incus and stapes) and the Eustachian tube, which leads from the middle ear to the back of the throat.
\n\nThe main organ for hearing, the  cochlea, is in the inner ear. The cochlea is the sense organ for hearing like the nose is for smelling. The middle ear bones are connected to the cochlea and the cochlea is connected to the  auditory nerve.
The auditory nerve is the nerve that runs from the inner ear (cochlea) to the brainstem. The cochlea sends signals to the auditory nerve; then the auditory nerve sends these signals to the brain.
Hearing loss can happen because of problems in any part of the auditory system.
        \n\nHearing is different than other senses like vision, smell and taste. The hearing system is about changing movement into a signal that the brain can understand. Sound travels through the air as vibrations in the air pressure (i.e. sound waves). It takes four steps through the auditory system before the brain can understand sounds.
	    \n\n<b>Step 1</b>: Sound moves into the ear through the outer ear and the ear canal. Once the sound has moved down the ear canal, the sound waves hit the eardrum, which makes the eardrum vibrate.
        \n\n<b>Step 2</b>: When the eardrum vibrates, it moves the bones of the middle part of the ear (malleus, incus and stapes). The movement of the malleus and incus makes the stapes move in and out of the entrance of the inner ear, the oval window.
	    \n\n<b>Step 3</b>: The other side of the oval window, in the inner ear, is filled with fluid. As the stapes moves back and forth on the oval window, it makes waves. This changes the vibrations of the middle ear into hydraulic energy.
	    \n\n<b>Step 4</b>: The hydraulic energy of the waves makes tiny hair cells in the  cochlea sway back and forth. The swaying action creates signals, which move through the  auditory nerve then up the levels of the brainstem until they reach the brain.
		\n\nDepending on the range of your audiogram results
		\nBelow is the classfication based upon decibel level:
		\n\n<b>Normal hearing</b> -> 0 to 20 dB
        \n\n<b>Mild</b> -> 21 to 40 dB
        \n\n<b>Moderate</b> -> 41 to 55 dB
        \n\n<b>Moderately-severe</b> -> 56 to 70 dB
        \n\n<b>Severe</b> -> 71 to 90 dB
        \n\n<b>Profound</b> -> 91+ dB</string>
