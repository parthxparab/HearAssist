Hearing loss detection through audiogram in mobile devices (HearAssist) is a mobile software project which is an attempt on creating an android application to demonstrate Android smartphone as an educational tool for hearing impairment. Hearing correction in Mobile devices is a software system which aims to help people with mild to moderate hearing loss, by first creating a medically accurate audiogram report of the audibility of the user and then using the audiogram graph to also generate a textual report for the convenience of the user. Apart from this, all the reports generated across any and all devices are stored online on a database for generating and visualising trends of hearing capabilities of users across various age groups.
